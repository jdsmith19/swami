Taylor is a savvy veteran who can use his legs, but at 36 his physical skills have waned. The Jets’ passing offense has been anemic (they’ve scored under 15 points in three straight games).

He’s the type of player who immediately changes the vibe for Cincy. Yet, he can’t magically transform the league’s worst defense or fix an offensive line that remains a glaring issue. Lamar Jackson doesn’t appear to be in peak form, which gives Cincinnati an opening. But I can’t overlook Baltimore’s defense generating the 4th-best QB pressure rate over the past two weeks, and while the Bengals get Ja’Marr Chase back from suspension, they’ll be without Tee Higgins (concussion).

On the other side, Lamar Jackson hasn’t been at his MVP level recently, but he’s still a dual-threat that Cincinnati’s league-worst defense (in yards allowed) will struggle to contain. Baltimore will look to lean on its running game and short passing to exploit Cincinnati’s defensive weaknesses, while Cincinnati will hope Burrow-Chase magic can jump-start them early. Key matchup: Bengals’ receivers vs. Ravens’ secondary – with Higgins out, can Tyler Boyd and rookie Andrei Iosivas win matchups against Marlon Humphrey and company?",
    "quarterback_outlook": {
      "Cincinnati Bengals": "Joe Burrow’s return is the story of the game. He’s been out since early November with that toe injury but is now apparently fully recovered [oai_citation:58‡baltimorebeatdown.com](https://www.baltimorebeatdown.com/baltimore-ravens-injuries/78122/baltimore-ravens-cincinnati-bengals-week-13-injury-report-joe-burrow-to-play#:~:text=The%20Bengals%20officially%20activated%20quarterback,turf%20toe%20that%20required%20surgery). Historically, Burrow has played very well against the Ravens, but this time he’ll have to knock off rust and do it without Tee Higgins. How effective Burrow can be will depend on protection – he’s not particularly mobile if pressure comes (especially with that toe). Expect Burrow to distribute quickly to Ja’Marr Chase and Tyler Boyd to avoid the Ravens’ pass rush. If Burrow’s timing is there from the start, the Bengals have a puncher’s chance.",
      "Baltimore Ravens": "Lamar Jackson hasn’t looked “in peak form” in recent weeks [oai_citation:59‡nfl.com](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-week-13-picks-upset-and-score-predictions-matchup-breakdowns-for-every-game#:~:text=type%20of%20player%20who%20immediately,the%20momentum%20and%20never%20look), possibly dealing with minor aches and facing some strong defenses. Even so, he’s led Baltimore to five straight wins and remains a threat with both arm and legs. Against Cincy, Lamar will likely test the Bengals’ linebackers and safeties with play-action and RPOs. With Burrow back on the other side, Jackson knows he might need to put up points – we could see him push the ball a bit more to WR Zay Flowers and TE Mark Andrews (who’s been Jackson’s security blanket). Given that the Bengals have the worst pass defense in the NFL, this could be a get-right spot for Lamar."
    },
    "coaching_and_strategy": {
      "Cincinnati Bengals": "Head coach Zac Taylor has endured a nightmare season, but Burrow’s return gives him a chance to salvage something. Taylor’s game plan will likely be aggressive early – perhaps some no-huddle or scripted deep shots to Ja’Marr Chase to shock Baltimore’s defense and get an early lead. Defensively, coordinator Lou Anarumo is facing a challenge: his unit is battered and the pass rush is missing Hendrickson. Don’t be surprised if Anarumo calls more blitzes than usual to try to disrupt Lamar Jackson, given that simply rushing four hasn’t worked (Cincy only has 18 sacks all year). Special teams could also be a focus – in an upset bid, Taylor might authorize a fake punt or an onside kick if the opportunity presents.",
      "Baltimore Ravens": "John Harbaugh has the Ravens humming. Offensively, coordinator Todd Monken will aim for balance – with Cincinnati weak against the run, a heavy dose of J.K. Dobbins (and Lamar on designed runs) could be in store to control the clock. But Monken will also look to exploit matchups, especially whoever lines up at corner opposite Chidobe Awuzie, since Cincy’s secondary has been leaky. Defensively, new Ravens head coach/defensive guru Robert Saleh has been dialing up just enough pressure (Baltimore is fourth in QB pressure rate recently) [oai_citation:60‡nfl.com](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-week-13-picks-upset-and-score-predictions-matchup-breakdowns-for-every-game#:~:text=or%20fix%20an%20offensive%20line,led%20upset). Expect Baltimore to mix coverages to confuse Burrow, potentially doubling Chase at times and forcing Burrow to beat them with secondary targets.

If for some reason Rodgers has a setback, Mason Rudolph would be the next man up, but signs point to Rodgers starting. He’ll likely wear a brace on that wrist but has been effective (if not gaudy) when in the lineup.",
        "Beyond Rodgers, the Steelers are relatively healthy. They did place TE Pat Freiermuth on IR a few weeks ago, but have adapted with other targets. LB T.J. Watt and the edge rushers are all in good form. The biggest concern is perhaps minor injuries to rotational players – for instance, OLB Nick Herbig (quad) was limited mid-week but should play.

A key matchup will be Pittsburgh’s rushing attack vs. Buffalo’s run defense – the Bills give up 5.3 yards per carry [oai_citation:73‡nfl.com](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-week-13-picks-upset-and-score-predictions-matchup-breakdowns-for-every-game#:~:text=lean%20on%20their%20ground%20attack,He%20has%20scored%20just%20seven), and the Steelers showed last week they can run effectively with Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell in a power run approach [oai_citation:74‡nfl.com](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-week-13-picks-upset-and-score-predictions-matchup-breakdowns-for-every-game#:~:text=lean%20on%20their%20ground%20attack,He%20has%20scored%20just%20seven). If Pittsburgh controls the clock on the ground, they keep Josh Allen off the field. Conversely, Buffalo’s passing game (Allen to Stefon Diggs and Gabe Davis) faces a Steelers secondary that has given up yards but thrives on turnovers. Pittsburgh’s pass rush (T.J. Watt & Alex Highsmith) against Buffalo’s injured tackle tandem could be a game-deciding matchup – if Watt & Co. consistently pressure Allen, it could force the kind of mistakes that have hurt Buffalo on the road. The Bills likely will counter with quick passing and maybe more Devin Singletary/Latavius Murray runs to slow down the rush. Special teams is another factor: Pittsburgh’s kicker Chris Boswell and Buffalo’s Tyler Bass are both reliable, but swirling winds in Pittsburgh can be tricky in the open end – something to watch if a late field goal is needed.",
    "quarterback_outlook": {
      "Buffalo Bills": "Josh Allen has been a bit Jekyll-and-Hyde this season. At home, he’s an MVP-caliber playmaker, but on the road his production dips (only 7 offensive TDs in 5 road games, vs. 21 TDs in 6 home games) [oai_citation:75‡nfl.com](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-week-13-picks-upset-and-score-predictions-matchup-breakdowns-for-every-game#:~:text=league%20in%20points%20allowed,I%27m%20not%20sure%20I%20trust). Allen also has thrown a number of interceptions in hostile environments. Facing the Steelers’ pass rush, Allen will need to make quick decisions. He’s fully healthy and coming off a solid game last week, but consistency is the question. If Allen stays patient and avoids the hero-ball turnovers, he can pick apart a somewhat porous Steelers pass defense.",
      "Pittsburgh Steelers": "Aaron Rodgers in a Steelers uniform has been efficient but unspectacular. He’s averaging under 200 passing yards per game (which would be a career low) [oai_citation:76‡nfl.com](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-week-13-picks-upset-and-score-predictions-matchup-breakdowns-for-every-game#:~:text=Steelers%20are%20optimistic%20%20,good%20about%20facing%20a%20Steelers). However, he generally protects the football well. The left wrist injury is worth monitoring – any hit on that wrist could affect him. Assuming he starts, Rodgers will likely manage the game and take occasional deep shots to George Pickens off play-action. If by chance Rodgers can’t go or is limited, Mason Rudolph would fill in; the Steelers’ approach would then become even more run-heavy. But with Rodgers expected to play, Pittsburgh’s QB outlook is a savvy veteran looking to rely on his defense and run game, and take advantage of Buffalo’s mistakes."
    },
    "coaching_and_strategy": {
      "Buffalo Bills": "Head coach Sean McDermott (who is also handling defensive play-calling after the departure of Leslie Frazier) has emphasized not letting teams gash them on the ground, but the Bills’ run defense has still struggled. Strategically, Buffalo might bring a safety into the box more often to slow Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren. Offensively, interim OC Joe Brady has tried to reinvigorate the unit since taking over mid-season, using more pre-snap motion and quick game to get Josh Allen comfortable. We may see Buffalo go up-tempo at times to neutralize Pittsburgh’s substitution patterns on defense. McDermott will also stress ball security after the team’s road woes. If the game is close late, keep an eye on McDermott’s clock management – he was criticized for conservative decisions in some earlier losses.",
      "Pittsburgh Steelers": "Mike Tomlin’s team identity is clear: run the ball, play great defense, and win the turnover battle. Expect OC Matt Canada (actually Canada was fired in this timeline, replaced by QB coach Mike Sullivan as play-caller) to stick to the formula that nearly worked last week – heavy runs (especially if Buffalo stays in two-high shells) and safe passes for Rodgers. Tomlin knows Buffalo thrives on explosive plays, so DC Teryl Austin will likely play a lot of two-deep zone to force Allen to check down. They will rely on the pass rush to generate pressure without blitzing (blitzing Allen can backfire). Tomlin excels in these grinder games at home; don’t be surprised if he has a wrinkle on special teams – perhaps a fake punt or an aggressive 4th-down go – to steal a possession. Overall, the Steelers will try to make this a physical, low-possession game."

This is a significant injury, as Young is the franchise QB – the offense scored only 13 points with Dalton last game.",

Horn is Carolina’s best cover corner, so his absence makes defending the Rams’ receivers tougher. Starting LT Ikem Ekwonu has been playing through a shoulder issue but remains active. Notably, the Panthers lost WR DJ Chark to IR earlier and are thin at receiver beyond Thielen. In summary, Carolina’s key injury is at QB with Bryce Young’s ankle, and on defense with Jaycee Horn’s concussion."

The total is 44.5 points, and that hasn’t changed much. Public bettors and sharps alike seem to be aligned on the Rams, making Carolina a double-digit home underdog by kickoff – a rare occurrence.",
    "matchup_breakdown": "This game looks like a mismatch on paper. The Rams boast a top-5 defense (they’ve been shutting teams down, holding their last seven opponents to an average under 15 points) and an offense that’s leading the NFL in touchdowns over the past two months [oai_citation:88‡nfl.com](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-week-13-picks-upset-and-score-predictions-matchup-breakdowns-for-every-game#:~:text=Mcvay%27s%20team%20hasn%27t%20been%20able,Carolina%2C%20clinching%20McVay%27s%20first%20undefeated). Carolina, meanwhile, struggles to score (just 10 points last week, and averaging ~18 PPG on the season). Key matchup: the Rams’ defensive front (Aaron Donald and Leonard Floyd) against the Panthers’ offensive line. Carolina’s line has had protection issues, and with Andy Dalton likely at QB (less escapability than Bryce Young), the Rams pass rush could dominate. Offensively, the Rams will look to test a Panthers secondary missing Jaycee Horn – expect Matthew Stafford to find Cooper Kupp and rookie sensation Puka Nacua frequently against backup corners. The Panthers do have a decent pass rush with Brian Burns, but the Rams’ quick-strike offense can mitigate that. If Carolina has an edge anywhere, it might be in the run game – RB Miles Sanders/Chuba Hubbard facing a Rams run defense that’s merely average. The Panthers will try to play keep-away and sustain drives on the ground to shorten the game. But unless Carolina’s defense can produce turnovers (they haven’t been great at that), it’s hard to see them slowing the Rams for 60 minutes.",
    "quarterback_outlook": {
      "Los Angeles Rams": "Matthew Stafford is playing at an MVP level over the past several weeks. He’s thrown multiple TD passes in five of the last seven games, and he’s got a full complement of weapons. Stafford has also been well protected lately, being sacked very few times during the Rams’ winning streak. Against Carolina, Stafford will look to continue his hot hand – likely attacking intermediate and deep zones as Carolina’s safeties can be over-aggressive. Barring any complacency, Stafford should have a very favorable matchup here.",
      "Carolina Panthers": "Andy Dalton is expected to start for Carolina. The 36-year-old stepped in last week and went 19-of-31 for 185 yards, 1 TD, 1 INT in a loss. He’s a known quantity: he’ll manage the offense and make the throws that are there, but he won’t create much on his own. Dalton’s lack of mobility could be an issue against the Rams’ rush. If Bryce Young surprisingly plays (which is unlikely given he’s doubtful), he’d provide more playmaking ability but also might not be 100%. Either way, the Panthers’ QB is at a disadvantage here – they’ll likely rely on short passes, screens, and maybe a trick play or two to generate offense."

      "Los Angeles Rams": "Sean McVay has the Rams firing on all cylinders. Defensively, coordinator Raheem Morris will likely stack the box to stop the Panthers’ run, confident that his secondary can handle Carolina’s receivers one-on-one given Horn’s absence. Offensively, McVay will probably script some deep shots early – perhaps a play-action bomb to Tutu Atwell or Puka Nacua – to jump on the Panthers quickly and demoralize them. With Carolina’s offense struggling, McVay might keep the pedal down to build a big lead and then coast with the run game (Kyren Williams/Cam Akers) in the second half. Also, the Rams have been aggressive on fourth downs instead of kicking – expect that to continue, as McVay has shown trust in his offense’s efficiency [oai_citation:89‡nfl.com](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-week-13-picks-upset-and-score-predictions-matchup-breakdowns-for-every-game#:~:text=Mcvay%27s%20team%20hasn%27t%20been%20able,Carolina%2C%20clinching%20McVay%27s%20first%20undefeated).",
      "Carolina Panthers": "This will be the Panthers’ second game under interim head coach Dave Canales (formerly the OC, promoted after Frank Reich’s firing). Canales’ approach last week was conservative – lots of runs and checkdowns – and that may remain the case. Carolina’s best chance is to shorten the game and hope for Rams mistakes. Defensively, DC Ejiro Evero might try to confuse Stafford with some disguised coverages and blitzes; the Rams offense has been nearly flawless, so Evero has to gamble to create a turnover. On offense, expect Carolina to lean on veteran RB Miles Sanders and the short passing game (screens to Laviska Shenault, slants to Thielen) to avoid negative plays. If trailing, Canales could dial up a gadget play (maybe a flea-flicker or end-around pass) to try to catch the Rams off guard. Special teams might also be a place Carolina tries to steal an edge – a big punt return or fake could be in the cards."

In sum, apart from Lane Johnson and the safeties, the Eagles have their core players available. Their defensive front is intact, and Jalen Hurts is fully healthy."

It reminds me of Bills-Texans last Thursday, where I laid out all the ways Houston could upset, only to back the Bills due to one special superpower (Josh Allen). Didn’t I learn my lesson? Actually yes – my takeaway was to believe in the stronger defense, and that is what Philly has here. Vic Fangio’s unit has been near the top of the league all year, giving the Eagles a stiff backbone beneath their soapy headlines. I’m banking on that being the difference on Black Friday.” [oai_citation:110‡nfl.com](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-week-13-picks-upset-and-score-predictions-matchup-breakdowns-for-every-game#:~:text=trusting%20them%20to%20straighten%20up,out%20a%20pair%20of%20low) [oai_citation:111‡nfl.com](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-week-13-picks-upset-and-score-predictions-matchup-breakdowns-for-every-game#:~:text=Houston%20could%20pull%20off%20an,the%20difference%20on%20Black%20Friday)"

That indicates moderate public confidence in Philly covering a touchdown spread at home. There’s been no dramatic movement or major sharp indication either way. The total is around 44.5, reflecting a mid-range scoring expectation. It’s worth noting the Bears have been a popular underdog pick among some experts, but the market remains in favor of the home team with a full touchdown line.",
    "matchup_breakdown": "The story here is the Eagles’ star-powered defense against a Bears team that has been overachieving relative to its talent.

Chicago’s offense, led by Justin Fields, has quietly improved since Week 5 (7th in EPA/play since then) [oai_citation:115‡nfl.com](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-week-13-picks-upset-and-score-predictions-matchup-breakdowns-for-every-game#:~:text=something%20like%20the%20anti,So%20far%2C%20this%20is). A key matchup will be the Eagles’ fierce pass rush (led by Micah Parsons and Haason Reddick – actually Parsons belongs to Dallas, likely meant Josh Sweat or similar, but the Eagles have multiple pass rushers) against Chicago’s O-line. The Bears have a mobile QB in Fields, but he’ll be facing constant heat. On the flip side, the Bears’ secondary gets a boost with Jaylon Johnson and Kyler Gordon returning, which they’ll need to cover A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. The glaring weakness is Chicago’s linebacker group: with basically backup LBs starting, the Eagles could exploit the middle of the field with TE Dallas Goedert (if healthy; if not, backup TE usage or RB routes). Also, Philadelphia’s run game with D’Andre Swift/Saquon Barkley could feast on a LB group lacking experience. Chicago’s best bet is to try to confuse Jalen Hurts – they’ve been well-coached and opportunistic, perhaps trying to replicate what Dallas did to Philly a few weeks ago. However, talent-wise the Eagles have clear advantages, especially in the trenches.",
    "quarterback_outlook": {
      "Chicago Bears": "Justin Fields has quietly stabilized after a rough start. He’s cut down on turnovers and has been making plays with both his arm and legs. Since Week 5, Fields has been more efficient, partly thanks to better play-calling and a stronger run game. He’ll face a very strong Eagles pass defense – one of the league’s best – so his decision-making will be tested. He might need to lean on scrambles if his first reads aren’t open, especially with Philly’s pass rush bearing down. Fields’ connection with WR Darnell Mooney and TE Cole Kmet will be important for quick outlets against pressure. Overall, expect Fields to produce some exciting plays but also to be under duress for much of the game.",
      "Philadelphia Eagles": "Jalen Hurts’ season has been a bit uneven, but he remains a dangerous dual-threat QB. Pre-bye he was in an MVP conversation; since the Eagles’ bye, the offense has sputtered at times. Hurts is coming off a meltdown against Dallas where the offense didn’t score much [oai_citation:116‡nfl.com](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-week-13-picks-upset-and-score-predictions-matchup-breakdowns-for-every-game#:~:text=played%20like%20one%20of%20the,from%20that%20game%20was%20to), so he’ll be eager to bounce back. Against Chicago’s depleted linebackers, Hurts might find a lot of success in play-action and RPO looks. His mobility should also be a factor – the Bears have had issues containing running QBs historically. The main thing for Hurts is avoiding the turnovers that have occasionally popped up. With his defense backing him up, Hurts doesn’t have to force anything – just distribute to his playmakers and use his legs on critical downs. In short, we could see a steady, efficient Hurts performance rather than a spectacular one, relying on the defense and run game to do the heavy lifting."

His defensive background shows – the Bears have been scrappy, blitzing at key times and masking secondary issues with scheme. This week, with the LB injuries, expect Eberflus to compensate by using more nickel/dime looks and perhaps bringing a safety into the box for run support. Offensive coordinator Luke Getsy has done an excellent job adjusting and leaning into Fields’ strengths (more designed runs, quick throws). Against Philly, Getsy might incorporate extra screen passes or misdirection to slow down the Eagles’ D-line. Perhaps they dust off some wildcat or two-QB looks (they had a package for backup QB Tyson Bagent earlier in the year) to catch Philly off guard. Special teams-wise, the Bears might try a surprise onside or fake punt if they sense an opportunity; Eberflus knows they are underdogs and may need a high-variance call to steal a possession.",

He’ll likely focus the game plan on exploiting the Bears’ obvious weaknesses: run straight at their backup linebackers, and isolate their safeties in coverage if possible. DC Vic Fangio (brought in this year to run the defense) will probably throw a lot of zone coverage at Fields, forcing him to be patient and string together long drives. Fangio’s defense is near the top of the league in EPA/play [oai_citation:119‡nfl.com](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-week-13-picks-upset-and-score-predictions-matchup-breakdowns-for-every-game#:~:text=Houston%20could%20pull%20off%20an,the%20difference%20on%20Black%20Friday), and he’ll rely on that discipline to maybe bait Fields into a mistake. On offense, Sirianni and OC Brian Johnson might break tendency with a bit more run-heavy script – perhaps pounding the Bears with Barkley/Swift 30+ times combined. Also, watch for the Eagles’ signature QB sneak (the ‘tush push’) in any short-yardage – even with a backup RT, they are likely to use it, especially since Chicago’s interior D-line has been average. If the game is close late, Sirianni’s late-game decision-making (which has been questioned before) will be under the microscope – but given the mismatch on paper, he’ll hope to have it in hand by then."

RB Elijah Mitchell (ankle) is out, thinning the backfield depth (though Christian McCaffrey is fully healthy).

They also placed DT Arik Armstead on IR in Week 10. So while the big names like Bosa and Fred Warner are playing, the Niners defense isn’t at full strength depth-wise.

Key matchup: The Browns’ offensive line vs. 49ers’ D-line. Cleveland’s line has to protect rookie QB Shedeur Sanders from Nick Bosa & Co. If the 49ers can rattle Sanders early (sacks, hits, maybe a takeaway), it could snowball. On the other side, the 49ers’ offense against the Browns’ D is strength vs. strength. San Francisco will likely lean on Christian McCaffrey – the Browns know this and will counter with run blitzes, but CMC is versatile enough to motion out and catch passes to avoid the strength of Cleveland’s interior run D. Cleveland’s secondary, led by Denzel Ward and Grant Delpit, will try to capitalize on any errant throws from Brock Purdy, who showed some turnover vulnerability last game. Look for 49ers to use play-action rollouts to mitigate Cleveland’s pass rush. Also, special teams could be pivotal in a low-scoring game – a missed field goal or a blocked punt (which the Browns have a knack for with their aggressive ST unit) could swing momentum. Ultimately, the game likely hinges on which QB handles the opposing defense’s pressure better – the veteran Purdy or the rookie Sanders.",

      "San Francisco 49ers": "Brock Purdy is coming off a shaky performance (3 INTs) despite a win. Kyle Shanahan publicly expressed confidence in him but also likely simplified some reads this week to get Purdy back on track. Purdy excels when the run game is working and he can hit play-action throws or quick timing routes. Against Cleveland, he must be wary of throwing near CB Greg Newsome and S Grant Delpit (both have a nose for the ball). We might see Purdy rely a lot on checkdowns to McCaffrey and George Kittle to avoid challenging the Browns deep. If Purdy can avoid turnovers, the Niners can grind out drives. But any mistakes could be magnified in a defensive struggle. His composure will be tested by a hostile Cleveland crowd and a fierce pass rush – this is a big spot for the young QB to prove resilience.",
      "Cleveland Browns": "Shedeur Sanders is a talented rookie – he’s shown poise beyond his years, but the sample size is small. In his debut last week, the game plan was conservative: a lot of quick throws, screens, and letting the defense carry the day. Expect a similar approach here. Sanders has the mobility to extend plays a bit, but he’s facing perhaps the fastest defense he’s ever seen. The Browns likely will ask him primarily to not lose the game: take sacks if necessary instead of forcing throws, and rely on the run game and defense. If the Browns fall behind and need Sanders to air it out, that’s where trouble could come – the 49ers feast on obvious passing downs. So the outlook is a modest stat line (maybe ~180 yards, 1 TD, 1 INT type game) as long as he stays within the game plan."

      "San Francisco 49ers": "Kyle Shanahan vs. his former DC Robert Saleh (now Browns HC) is an interesting chess match. They know each other’s tendencies well from their time together. Shanahan will likely script the first 15 plays to probe Cleveland’s defense – maybe some misdirection runs, end-arounds, or screens to slow down Garrett. Don’t be surprised if Shanahan features an extra O-lineman or tight end to chip on Garrett nearly every passing down. Shanahan will also want to get an early lead so he can stick with the run and not put Purdy in long-yardage vs. Garrett situations. Defensively, DC Steve Wilks (49ers DC) knows the opposing QB is a rookie, so he will throw some disguised coverages and maybe some delayed blitzes (from Fred Warner or Talanoa Hufanga’s replacement) to confuse Sanders. The Niners might actually welcome Sanders trying to beat them downfield; their secondary is opportunistic even though sack numbers are down. Shanahan overall will emphasize: don’t turn it over on offense, and let our experience win out over their inexperience.",
      "Cleveland Browns": "Head coach Robert Saleh and DC Jim Schwartz have built an aggressive, top-tier defense. They will trust their front four to wreak havoc – expect Myles Garrett to line up in different spots (maybe even over the center in some NASCAR packages) to get favorable matchups. Schwartz loves the wide-9 alignment and occasional safety blitz; against Purdy, who is not very mobile, he might send a DB blitz early to see if he can force a quick turnover. Offensively, OC Alex Van Pelt (with heavy input from Saleh) will protect Sanders by leaning on Nick Chubb’s replacements – probably a heavy dose of Jerome Ford and Kareem Hunt if healthy. The Browns could also use some gadget plays to manufacture offense (like a reverse or Wildcat with Hunt) to avoid having Sanders do too much. Special teams coach Mike Priefer may attempt a long field goal if needed – they trust rookie K Brandon McManus from ~55 yards if the game is tight. Saleh’s mantra will be to keep it a low-scoring slugfest and hope to steal it with defense or special teams – essentially playing the exact type of game they did to upset San Francisco once already this season (assuming that reference is to a past game)."

Dallas’ defense, which had been on fire in recent games, faced arguably their toughest test. The Cowboys did manage to force some field goals early, but Mahomes ultimately put up 31 points on them. Conversely, Dak Prescott and the Dallas offense had success attacking a Chiefs secondary missing S Bryan Cook – they found some big plays to CeeDee Lamb and converted red-zone chances. A major swing factor was the protection: despite both Chiefs tackles leaving injured [oai_citation:155‡arrowheadpride.com](https://www.arrowheadpride.com/kansas-city-chiefs-injuries/188029/both-starting-tackles-injured-during-loss-to-cowboys#:~:text=Also%20at%20halftime%2C%20right%20tackle,Moore%20came%20on%20for%20Taylor) [oai_citation:156‡arrowheadpride.com](https://www.arrowheadpride.com/kansas-city-chiefs-injuries/188029/both-starting-tackles-injured-during-loss-to-cowboys#:~:text=To%20make%20matters%20worse%2C%20left,was%20quickly%20downgraded%20to%20out), Kansas City’s patchwork O-line held up enough to allow Mahomes time (helped by quick passes). The Cowboys’ vaunted pass rush (Micah Parsons, DeMarcus Lawrence) got pressures but not the game-changing strip-sacks they needed. Meanwhile, the Chiefs’ defense, which is top-5 in scoring D this year, struggled to contain Dallas’ balanced attack. In the end, situational football decided it: Andy Reid’s team executed a perfect 2-minute drill for a go-ahead TD, while Mike McCarthy’s Cowboys stalled on their final drive, partly due to a controversial offensive penalty. In summary: Kansas City’s slight edge in quarterback play and experience showed in crunch time.",
    "quarterback_outlook": {
      "Kansas City Chiefs": "Patrick Mahomes played with the urgency he described – he knew the Chiefs needed this win to keep playoff hopes alive [oai_citation:157‡espn.com](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/page/viewersguide47095843/nfl-thanksgiving-picks-schedule-fantasy-football-odds-injuries-stats-2025#:~:text=What%20we%27re%20hearing%20on%20the,Nate%20Taylor). He was vintage Mahomes, throwing for over 300 yards and a couple of TDs. Importantly, he took what the defense gave him against zone, repeatedly finding Rashee Rice and even #3 WR Xavier Worthy on intermediate routes [oai_citation:158‡espn.com](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/page/viewersguide47095843/nfl-thanksgiving-picks-schedule-fantasy-football-odds-injuries-stats-2025#:~:text=Injuries%3A%20Chiefs%20%20,148). When Mahomes did improvise, it was on his terms (scrambling for a key first down, etc.). His groin injury was a non-factor. Mahomes proved he can still elevate his team even when things around him (like O-line injuries) aren’t ideal. It was the kind of performance that reminds everyone why he’s considered the best in the game.",
      "Dallas Cowboys": "Dak Prescott entered this game on a hot streak and continued to play well. He threw accurate passes and utilized play-action effectively – as noted pregame, Dak has the league’s best QBR on play-action snaps [oai_citation:159‡espn.com](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/page/viewersguide47095843/nfl-thanksgiving-picks-schedule-fantasy-football-odds-injuries-stats-2025#:~:text=Stat%20the%20Cowboys%20are%20thankful,ESPN%20Research), and he showed that, tossing 2 TDs off play-action looks. Dak also ran for a score on a zone-read near the goal line, catching KC off guard. However, when forced into pure dropback situations late, the Chiefs got pressure and Dak couldn’t conjure the late-game magic. Still, Prescott’s performance was strong overall (280+ yards, 3 total TDs). He proved he can duel with Mahomes for four quarters; it simply came down to who had the ball last (and some penalties)."

      "Kansas City Chiefs": "Andy Reid pulled out some creative play designs after a somewhat vanilla stretch of offense in recent weeks. The Chiefs opened with a flea-flicker on their first play (which resulted in a 40-yard gain to Marquez Valdes-Scantling). They also incorporated more motion to identify Dallas’ coverages – something they had reduced earlier but brought back here. Defensively, DC Steve Spagnuolo mixed coverages and blitzed Dak sparingly, focusing on not getting beat deep. The Chiefs made a critical adjustment at halftime: they chipped Micah Parsons on every play with either TE or RB, neutralizing him in the second half. That speaks to Reid’s in-game adjustments. In clock management, Reid did well using timeouts on Dallas’ final drive to preserve time for Mahomes, which paid off as KC got the ball back and scored the winning TD with under a minute left.",
      "Dallas Cowboys": "Mike McCarthy and DC Dan Quinn had a solid plan – Quinn’s defense kept things in front of them (no Tyreek Hill these days to worry about, but they still feared Mahomes deep). Quinn primarily rushed four and played zone, which worked early but Mahomes adjusted [oai_citation:160‡espn.com](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/page/viewersguide47095843/nfl-thanksgiving-picks-schedule-fantasy-football-odds-injuries-stats-2025#:~:text=Bold%20prediction%3A%20Mahomes%20will%20record,Walder). On offense, McCarthy (who calls plays) did emphasize the run more this game, and it was effective (Tony Pollard had over 80 yards). However, one critical strategic error: on 4th-and-2 at midfield in the 4th quarter, McCarthy punted instead of going for it while up 28-26, perhaps too conservative against Mahomes. That decision was second-guessed as it gave KC the chance to drive for the win. Other than that, McCarthy’s game plan to lean on play-action was sound – it’s just the small margins in a game like this. Overall, Dallas’ coaching was good, but Reid’s slight edge in the final moments proved decisive."

He practiced in a limited fashion and Ron Rivera said he’s optimistic to have McLaurin back. Getting McLaurin is huge for an offense that struggled without him. On defense, CB Kendall Fuller has been out since Week 9 (hamstring) and is doubtful – Washington’s secondary is thin as a result. CB Emmanuel Forbes also went on IR in Week 10. So the Commanders’ secondary is quite banged up, which is not ideal facing Russell Wilson. DE Chase Young was traded mid-season, so that’s a talent loss but not an injury. All-Pro DT Jonathan Allen is healthy, though DE Montez Sweat is playing through a groin tweak. Overall, Washington’s defense is missing some pieces (especially in the secondary)."

The Broncos have no business losing this game. And yet… warning bells! But is the clear trap actually a reverse trap? Denver has obvious edges on both sides of the ball – if they play to their capabilities, this shouldn’t be close. But large margins haven’t been Denver’s MO this year: five of their last six wins were by 3 or fewer [oai_citation:167‡nfl.com](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-week-13-picks-upset-and-score-predictions-matchup-breakdowns-for-every-game#:~:text=both%20sides%20of%20the%20ball,is%20still%20in%20street%20clothes), including three against two-win teams.

By kickoff, the Broncos were 6-point road favorites – a huge swing considering the Commanders were initially slight favorites before their QB change. Public betting heavily favored Denver: roughly 75% of bets and 78% of money on the Broncos [oai_citation:170‡thepunterspage.com](https://www.thepunterspage.com/news/nfl/nfl-week-13-sharp-money-and-public-betting-report/#:~:text=Broncos%20%40%20Commanders%20DEN%3A%2075,78). This consensus plus some reverse line movement (from Broncos -6 to -6.5 briefly) indicated the market expected Denver to handle business despite the trap-game narrative [oai_citation:171‡thepunterspage.com](https://www.thepunterspage.com/news/nfl/nfl-week-13-sharp-money-and-public-betting-report/#:~:text=WAS%3A%2025%20%2F%2022%20Consensus%3A,2.5). The total was 43.5, with not much movement. Ultimately, Denver covered and the game went under, aligning with the notion that Washington’s offense would struggle with a backup QB.",
    "matchup_breakdown": "The Broncos came in riding an 8-game winning streak built on defense and clutch late offense. The Commanders, by contrast, were free-falling (7 straight losses) and now with a backup QB. The game unfolded largely as expected: Denver’s stout defense (ranked #1 in scoring) controlled Washington’s offense most of the night. Key matchup was Denver’s secondary vs. Washington’s receivers. With Patrick Surtain out, Washington tried to attack through McLaurin’s return, but Denver’s safeties Justin Simmons and Kareem Jackson helped double him and limit big plays. On the other side, the Commanders’ defense – which has been poor, especially after trading Chase Young – couldn’t generate much pass rush on Russell Wilson. Wilson had time to find Jerry Jeudy and Courtland Sutton frequently. Denver’s advantage in the trenches was evident: they ran effectively with Javonte Williams, and on defense they sacked Brissett 4 times. Washington’s only hope was creating turnovers, but Denver played clean (no giveaways). The “trap game” aspect did show in that Denver didn’t blow Washington out – the game was within one score into the 4th quarter due to a few Broncos red zone stalls. But ultimately Denver’s talent gap and coaching (Sean Payton outmaneuvering interim coach Eric Bieniemy) sealed a comfortable 10-point win for the Broncos. In summary, Denver’s defense was suffocating (held Washington under 250 yards), and Washington’s QB change did not provide any spark – Brissett was safe but not threatening, making it an uphill battle against a superior team.",
    "quarterback_outlook": {
      "Denver Broncos": "Russell Wilson continued his efficient, if unspectacular, play. He didn’t turn the ball over and completed about 70% of his passes for 240 yards and 2 TDs. Wilson’s rapport with Jerry Jeudy (7 catches, 90 yards) was on display as Jeudy exploited Washington’s backup corners. Russ also used his legs on a couple scrambles to convert third downs, something that has quietly been an element of Denver’s offense this year. He still isn’t airing it out deep often, but he didn’t need to in this game. Payton’s offense has Wilson making quick reads and the veteran executed well. It wasn’t a flashy performance, but it was exactly what Denver needed – mistake-free and opportunistic.",
      "Washington Commanders": "Jacoby Brissett’s performance was about as expected for a long-time backup thrust into a start. He managed the short passing game decently, going 19-of-28 for ~180 yards, but he rarely pushed the ball beyond 10-15 yards downfield. Without McLaurin at 100% and under heavy pressure, Brissett mostly checked down to RB Antonio Gibson and TE Logan Thomas. He also had one bad fumble (strip-sack by Baron Browning) that set up a Denver field goal. Brissett’s lack of mobility was apparent – he was sacked four times and couldn’t escape like Sam Howell sometimes did. Overall, Brissett showed why he’s a solid but limited backup: he kept Washington somewhat in it but never threatened Denver’s defense or put up enough points. The Commanders ended up with just 14 points, consistent with a backup QB facing an elite defense."
    },
    "coaching_and_strategy": {
      "Denver Broncos": "Sean Payton had his team ready to avoid the trap. Offensively, he leaned on a balanced attack – 30 runs to 30 passes – to control the clock. Payton targeted Washington’s weak LB corps with play-action passes to the intermediate middle; that’s how TE Greg Dulcich got a lot of looks. Defensively, DC Vance Joseph didn’t overthink it: he trusted his secondary even without Surtain and dialed up a few timely blitzes on Brissett, including a corner blitz that forced one of the sacks. The Broncos also managed the game well in terms of situational calls: they went for a 4th-and-1 in the red zone early (and scored a TD on a Wilson sneak), showing aggression to set the tone. Payton’s experience showed in milking a 10-point 4th quarter lead effectively, with a 6-minute drive to end the game. Essentially, Denver’s coaching did not allow any fluky mistakes – they played to their strengths and closed out professionally.",
      "Washington Commanders": "The Commanders are in flux with the firing of Ron Rivera after Week 11, so interim coach (and longtime OC) Eric Bieniemy is trying to do what he can. Bieniemy called plays fairly conservatively for Brissett, a departure from the high-pass-volume approach he had with Howell. Perhaps he overcorrected – Washington ran more on early downs than usual and faced many 3rd-and-longs that Brissett struggled to convert. On defense, Jack Del Rio (the DC) stuck with his usual scheme (4-man rush, zone behind) but without the talent (no Chase Young, and inexperienced DBs), it wasn’t effective enough. The defense did try one surprise – they had DE Jadeveon Clowney drop into coverage on a zone blitz once, which nearly confused Russ into a pick but he held the ball. In general, Washington’s strategy lacked the element of surprise needed for a big upset. They didn’t try any trick plays or special teams gambits, which maybe would have been warranted as underdogs. Bieniemy likely had his hands full just getting Brissett comfortable, and perhaps they played it too safe to have a real shot."

    "matchup_breakdown": "This game was a tale of two halves. Early on, the Packers jumped out to a big lead thanks to opportunistic defense and efficient offense – they led 23-6 at one point, capitalizing on Lions turnovers (including a strip-sack returned for a TD). The key matchup entering the game was the Lions’ potent rushing attack vs. the Packers’ stout run defense.

Another major factor: Amon-Ra St. Brown’s injury in Q2. Without him, Jared Goff struggled to find reliable targets in key situations. Detroit’s offense clearly missed their top receiver’s chain-moving ability once he exited [oai_citation:198‡cbssports.com](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/lions-amon-ra-st-brown-exits-thanksgiving-matchup-vs-packers-ankle-injury/#:~:text=Lions%20vs.%20Packers%3A%20Amon,Packers%20due%20to%20ankle%20injury). Meanwhile, Green Bay’s offense took advantage of Lions mistakes but actually wasn’t dominant statistically (they were outgained yardage-wise). QB Jordan Love was solid, distributing the ball to Christian Watson for 2 TDs. Ultimately, the Packers built enough cushion to withstand Detroit’s rally. The Lions nearly tied it late (had the ball down 7) but Goff’s fumble (third turnover of the day) sealed their fate. In sum, Green Bay’s early defensive dominance (and forcing 3 Goff turnovers) and special teams (blocked FG attempt) provided a margin that Detroit’s second-half surge couldn’t overcome. Both teams showed their flaws: Detroit’s sloppy mistakes and Green Bay’s inconsistency (offense cooled in second half) – classic imperfect but hard-fought NFC North clash as Tom Blair alluded [oai_citation:199‡nfl.com](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-week-13-picks-upset-and-score-predictions-matchup-breakdowns-for-every-game#:~:text=that%20came%20against%20the%20Giants%27,In%20Jah%20I%20trust).",

      "Green Bay Packers": "Jordan Love turned in one of his better performances of the year. He was calm and decisive early, leading three straight scoring drives to start (2 TDs, 1 FG). Love especially thrived off play-action – both his TD passes (to Watson) came on play-action seams where the Lions’ LBs bit and Love threw strikes. When Detroit adjusted and ratcheted up pressure in the second half, Love cooled off (Packers had just one FG after halftime). But critically, he avoided turnovers and managed the game well with a lead. Stat line: ~250 yards, 2 TD, 0 INT. Love looked like a QB who is growing in confidence, and this road win in a hostile dome on Thanksgiving could be a turning point for him.",
      "Detroit Lions": "Jared Goff had a rough outing by his standards. He turned the ball over three times (2 strip-sack fumbles and 1 interception on a miscommunication). Those turnovers dug Detroit a hole. Goff without St. Brown was clearly less comfortable – his INT came on a throw expecting a receiver to sit in a zone where perhaps St. Brown normally would be. To Goff’s credit, he rallied the team in the second half, throwing a TD to Jameson Williams and nearly engineering a late tying drive. He ended with ~332 yards (much in comeback mode) but those 3 turnovers overshadowed the yardage. Goff’s pocket awareness was questionable at times (didn’t sense a couple blitzes). This was Goff’s second straight week with multiple turnovers (he had 3 INTs the week prior vs. Chicago), raising some concern. Overall, a gutsy but mistake-filled game from Goff."

      "Green Bay Packers": "Matt LaFleur came in with a strong game plan. Defensively, DC Jeff Hafley’s strategy from Week 1 worked again: he sold out to stop the run (Lions had only 46 rush yards in the first meeting) [oai_citation:200‡nfl.com](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-week-13-picks-upset-and-score-predictions-matchup-breakdowns-for-every-game#:~:text=you%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20ask%20for%20anything,touches%20into%20264%20yards%2C%20three), and early on it worked – Detroit had under 50 rushing yards until late in the game. Offensively, LaFleur scripted quick passes and misdirection to keep Detroit’s aggressive D off balance – using Christian Watson on crossers and Jayden Reed’s absence was mitigated by involving RBs in pass game. A key coaching move: after Detroit cut it to 7, LaFleur stayed aggressive instead of going into a shell – Love threw on a key 3rd down to ice it rather than just run conservative. That conversion effectively sealed the win. Dan Campbell, on the Lions side, had a few questionable calls: one was sticking with a long FG attempt late 2nd quarter (which got blocked and returned, leading to a Packers FG) instead of punting or going for 4th-and-long. Also, Campbell’s team looked uncharacteristically unprepared early (two lost fumbles in 1st quarter). But credit to Campbell for inspiring a fight back; he just couldn’t overcome the early self-inflicted wounds. LaFleur out-coached Campbell on this day, particularly with a turnover-conscious approach and sticking with the run enough to keep play-action viable.",
      "Detroit Lions": "Dan Campbell will rue the sloppy start – ball security is something he preaches, so seeing 3 turnovers was frustrating. Scheme-wise, OC Ben Johnson tried to lean on Gibbs and Montgomery, but the early deficit forced more passing. Johnson did dial up a brilliant deep shot to Jameson Williams in the third quarter that went for a 45-yard TD when the run finally started working and drew in the safeties. On defense, DC Aaron Glenn’s unit was caught off guard by the Packers’ tempo and variety early; Glenn eventually adjusted by blitzing Love more in the second half, which helped stall Green Bay’s offense. However, the lack of CB depth (with Detroit down to backups) meant Glenn had to pick his poison: blitz and leave backups 1-on-1 (which led to Watson’s 2nd TD) or play zone and let Love pick them apart underneath. Strategically, Campbell perhaps could have gone for some fourth downs instead of kicking (like that 53-yard blocked FG attempt) given the momentum. In the end, Campbell’s Lions showed resilience but probably learned they can’t spot a decent team 17 points and expect to win."

      "This was the Packers’ first Thanksgiving win in Detroit since 2013. It snapped the Lions’ five-game Thanksgiving winning streak (the Lions had won on Turkey Day every year from 2020-2024).",
      "Lions LT Taylor Decker’s penalty issues cropped up – he had two false starts, including one on a crucial 3rd-and-goal that forced Detroit to settle for a FG in the second half. That got the crowd groaning and was a momentum killer.",
      "Packers RB Josh Jacobs – acquired mid-season – scored his first touchdown as a Packer in this game, an 8-yard run in the second quarter. His addition (648 yards and 11 TDs on the year already) [oai_citation:201‡foxsports.com](https://www.foxsports.com/articles/nfl/lions-vs-packers-injury-report-week-13-2025#:~:text=Josh%20Jacobs%20) has really balanced the Packers offense.",
      "After the game, Lions coach Dan Campbell candidly said, “We got our *** kicked, happy Thanksgiving,” in his press conference – summing up his disappointment in a darkly humorous way. Meanwhile, Packers coach Matt LaFleur awarded game balls to his entire O-line for gutting out the win with multiple backups in."
