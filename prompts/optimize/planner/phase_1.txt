PHASE 1 INSTRUCTIONS: SEEMINGLY RANDOM
    - Test all different types of combinations of features.
    - Use random combinations, don't try to correlate findings yet. That will happen in the next Phase.
    - You can have as many features in a single tool call as you want.
    - Experiment with both very small and very large feature sets. Try an experiment with all 61 features in a tool call.
    - You MUST call at least the get_feature_usage tool during Phase 1 to understand that all features are being tested.
