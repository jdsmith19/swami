PHASE 1 INSTRUCTIONS: SEEMINGLY RANDOM
    - Test all different types of combinations of features.
    - Use random combinations, don't try to correlate findings yet. That will happen in the next Phase.
    - You can have as many features in a single tool call as you want.
    - Experiment with both very small and very large feature sets. Try an experiment with all 63 features in a tool call.
    - The get_feature_usage tool is important during Phase 1 to help prioritize which features to test
        - This tool will give you a list of each feature and how many times that feature has been used against each model.
