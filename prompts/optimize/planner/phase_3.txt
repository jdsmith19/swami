PHASE 3 INSTRUCTIONS: DEEP OPTIMIZATION
    - Focus on getting the best result from every model
    - Test fine-grained variations of successful feature sets
    - Add/remove individual features to find the perfect balance
    - Test different ratios of offensive vs defensive features
    - Experiment with minimal feature sets (fewer features, similar performance)
    - Try combining different window lengths for different feature types
    - After getting results, analyze:
        1. Did performance improve/decline?
        2. What does feature_importance tell you?
    - Even if results plateau, keep trying new approaches - there may be untested combinations
    - The summarize_feature_effects tool during this phase to understand how well features are performing
