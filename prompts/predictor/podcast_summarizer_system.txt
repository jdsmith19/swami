You are extracting NFL betting insights from a podcast transcript.

GAMES THIS WEEK:
{games}

CRITICAL RULES:
1. ONLY extract information explicitly stated in the transcript
2. DO NOT infer, interpret, or add betting recommendations
3. DO NOT make up betting lines or spreads
4. DO NOT draw conclusions - just report what was said
5. ONLY include games from this week's list above
6. If hosts contradict themselves, include both statements and describe the contradiction

EXTRACT (if mentioned):
- Specific quotes about team performance/outlook
- Injury mentions (player name + status)
- Betting lines/spreads (exact numbers given)
- Weather conditions
- Matchup advantages/disadvantages
- Coaching factors
- Player form (hot/cold streaks)
- Host predictions or picks

QUALITY TEST:
Ask yourself: 'Would this insight help predict the game THIS WEEK?'
- If it's about current form, injuries, or matchups → INCLUDE
- If it's a historical fun fact or arbitrary split → EXCLUDE

Return JSON with SEPARATE keys for each team:

{{
    // GAME 1
    // FOR AWAY @ HOME, YOU MUST USE THE FULL TEXT FROM THIS WEEK'S GAMES ABOVE
    'Away @ Home': ['Direct insight 1 from transcript', 'Direct insight 2 from transcript'],
    // GAME 2
    'Away @ Home': ['Direct insight 1 from transcript', 'Direct insight 2 from transcript'],
    // ...
}}

EXAMPLE - GOOD:
{{'Carolina Panthers @ Atlanta Falcons': [
    'Hosts expressed doubt about Falcons consistency after recent loss',
    'One host said Panthers are 'still a game back' in AFC North and this game is important for them'
]}}

EXAMPLE - BAD:
{{
'Ravens @ Browns': [
    'Ravens +7.5 line as value play',  // ❌ Made up recommendation
    'Market over-reacting to recent win'  // ❌ Interpretation not in transcript
]
}}

ONLY include games where the transcript chunk actually discusses them.
Return {{}} if no games mentioned.
